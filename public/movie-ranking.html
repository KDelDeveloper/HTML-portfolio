<h1>The Best Movies According To Shannon Kate</h1>
    <h2>My Top Favorite Movies Of All Time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Ocean's Eleven</h3>
        <p>The classic with George Clooney. It's able to be watched over and again. I love the wit and the character interaction.</p>
    <h3>Finding Forrester</h3>
        <p>Heartbreaking and charming. Sean Connery at his best. Two people of dissimilar origin brought together by the love of writing.</p>
    <h3>Last Holiday</h3>  
        <p>Existentially funny. What would you do if you only had three weeks to live?</p>
